Aim of this paradigm
1. Minimize repeating of code by packing commonly used combinations of operations into functions
    in my colorEvoHelpers package
2. Establish a simple pipeline where "prep.R" or "prep_from_saved.R" is all that is needed to be ready for "describe.Rmd", "analysis.Rmd", and "paper_plots.Rmd"
3. Keep track of everything that has been attempted as independent, repeatable code chunks


prep.R contains calls to prep functions and adds dataframes to the R environment

all Rmds contain independent code chunks that will ALL run properly after prep is run
describe.Rmd visualizes distributions and correlations of predictors and responses, spatial distributions,
    cutoffs and clustering, and other project specific descriptive questions

analyze.Rmd contains more formal analysis taking into account what was discovered in describe, including
    an overview of hypotheses, model selection, linear mixed modeling, and phylogenetic comparative methods

paper_plots.Rmd contains the cream of the analysis crop turned into publication-ready figures
