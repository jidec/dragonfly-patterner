Steps for those starting fresh without any data (Louis or Rob won't have to do this)
    1. download an iNat or GBIF .csv containing all observations of taxon (Odonata) and place in data
    2. run R/getGenusList.R to create list of all genera from all observations
    3. run downloaders/downloadOdonataImages.py to download images from genera in genus list
    4. run R/moveSelectImages.R to move random images to annotation tasks within annotations folder

One-time step for merging split csvs to create inat_odonata_usa.csv (Louis and Rob will have to do this, unsplit is 300 MB so cannot be on GitHub easily)
    1. run data/split/mergeCSV.py

Steps for preparing an annotation task (Jacob will probably do this)
    1. in the annotations/*personsname* folder make a new folder with a date for the new annotation session
    2. run R/moveSelectImages.R to move images to this new annotations folder
    3. AFTER annotation task is complete, run R/concatAnnotations.R to merge the new annotation with a .csv containing all annotations

Steps for annotators (Jacob & Louis)
    1. in the annotations/*yourname* folder make a new folder with a date for the new annotation session
    2. run imageant (either on your computer, or the .exe included in the annotations folder in the repo)
    3. click File -> New Image Annotation Session
    4. name the session file within the annotations/*yourname*/*sessionname* folder
    5. pick the annotations/*yourname*/*sessionname* folder as the image folder
    6. pick odo_view_annot.ias from the annotations folder as the script
    7. annotate using the keys to answer the prompts, you can save and exit and return if you want
    8. when done go File -> Save Annotations
    9. on Github Desktop make a commit using the "commit to main" button (this will add the files you created in ImageAnt) 
    10. hit the "push origin" button to push your additions to the repository
