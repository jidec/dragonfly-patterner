Directories
	pipeline - contains complete pipeline components
	experiments - contains WIP pipeline components
   downloaders - contains scripts to download images
   data - contains images, all saved annotations, raw odonata data, and processed segments
   annotations - contains annotation tasks (class & seg) and ImageAnt and Fiji macros for annotation
   dpR - contains R scripts to organize directories and run analyses
    


Steps for those starting fresh without any data (Louis or Rob won't have to do this)
    1. download an iNat or GBIF csv containing all observations of taxon (Odonata), name it "inat_odonata_usa.csv" and place in data
	2. run data/split/splitCSV.py to split the large csv into smaller csvs to allow GitHub pushing without Git LFS 
    2. run R/getGenusList.R to create list of all genera from all observations in inat_odonata_usa.csv, genus_list.csv gets placed in data folder automatically
    3. run downloaders/downloadOdonataImages.py to download images from genera in genus list, images get placed in data/all_images folder automatically 

One-time step for merging split csvs to create inat_odonata_usa.csv (Louis and Rob will have to do this, unsplit is 300 MB so cannot be on GitHub without Git LFS)
    1. run data/split/mergeCSV.py

Steps for preparing an annotation task (Jacob will do this, possibly Louis)
    1. in the annotations/*personsname* folder make a new folder with a date for the new annotation session
    2. run R/moveSelectImages.R with the annotations/*personsname*/*sessionname* as a parameter to move images to this new annotations folder
    3. AFTER annotation task is complete, run R/concatAnnotations.R to merge the new annotation with a .csv containing all annotations

Steps for annotators (Jacob & Louis)
    1. in the annotations/*yourname* folder make a new folder with a date and name for the new annotation session i.e. 2-4-22_100Segments or 2-2-22_500Aeshnidae
    2. run imageant (either on your computer, or the .exe included in the annotations folder in the repo)
    3. click File -> New Image Annotation Session
    4. name the session file within the annotations/*yourname*/*sessionname* folder
    5. pick the annotations/*yourname*/*sessionname* folder as the image folder
    6. pick odo_view_annot.ias from the annotations folder as the script
    7. annotate using the keys to answer the prompts, you can save and exit and return if you want
    8. when done go File -> Save Annotations
    9. on Github Desktop make a commit using the "commit to main" button (this will add the files you created in ImageAnt) 
    10. hit the "push origin" button to push your additions to the repository 
	
Steps for segment annotation enjoyers (Jacob & Louis)
    1. install Fiji (https://imagej.net/software/fiji/downloads) if it's not already installed
	2. start Fiji, go to Plugins -> Macros -> Install and select sioux_segment_helper.ijm to install the helper macro
	3. go to Plugins -> Macros and click the new SIOUX Segment Helper macro that appeared to run it 
	4. a file browser will appear, pick the folder containing images in the annotation task folder 
    5. images will load into SIOUX one by one, see (https://imagej.net/plugins/siox) for how to use SIOUX
	6. basically just paint over some parts of the background and foreground then hit the Segment button then create Mask, then use the brush tool to refine the Mask a bit 
	7. click the OK button to save the mask and move to the next image
	8. the script only uses images that don't already have masks so you can resume easily
