    Returns a list of all raster image files in a specified directory.  The
    list elements are full paths (either relative or absolute, depending on the
    value of "dirname").  If "inspect" is True, the actual contents of each
    file will be inspected to determine if the file is an image file.  If
    False, file name extensions will be used to determine file type.  If
    possible, "inspect" should be False for processing large image libraries
    because it is much faster.  On a typical laptop running GNU/Linux with
    Python 2.7, file contents inspection takes ~2.37 times longer than file
    name extension filtering.  Oddly, the performance gap is even worse with
    Python 3.5, where file contents inspection takes ~2.89 times longer.

    sort: If True, the file names are returned in ascending alphanumeric sorted
        order.
    cs_sort: If True, the sort on file names will be case-sensitive.
    inspect: If True, inspect file contents to determine file types; otherwise,
        use file name extensions to determine file types.

    """
    A subclass of multithreading.Thread designed for downloading image files.

    I investigated three alternative implementations for HTTP downloads:
    requests, urllib, and wget (using subprocesses).  I tested the performance
    of all three using a sample of 100 image URIs from iDigBio.  For the
    requests and urllib implementations, I also experimented with different
    chunk/buffer sizes.  For all implementations, I experimented with different
    numbers of threads: 1, 10, 20, and 40.  I found that urllib consistently
    produced the best results, with the requests and wget implementations
    performing similarly, but neither as fast as urllib.  Larger chunk sizes (1
    KB or greater) significantly improved the performance of requests, but even
    going up to 1 MB chunks, it still was slower than urllib.  Although the
    documentation suggests that None should work as a chunk size, the downloads
    always hung when I tried this.  The default urllib buffer size (16*1024)
    seemed to work quite well, but I found some evidence that performance
    improved very slightly when I increased this to 1 MB, so that is the
    default.  On the test set, 10, 20, and 40 threads all performed similarly,
    but 20 appeared to be the optimal number for the test set, so that is the
    default.  Here are sample benchmarks from server-class hardware for urllib
    with a 1 MB buffer size (best time of 3 trials for each test):
         1 thread : 2 m, 19.16 s
        10 threads: 0 m, 20.10 s
