A unified pipeline to extract & analyze organismal color & pattern information using mass images from iNaturalist

Includes a modular data-management scheme plus Python and R scripts for managing data, creating training sets, classifying images, segmenting, extracting color patterns, and analyzing organismal patterns across phylogenetic and spatiotemporal scales

Will ultimately be compatible with other image databases such as AntWeb and OdonataCentral and turned into a Python package
